WHAT IS IT
=====

Currently this tool will create a statistical breakdown for words used by two
groups of twitter users. 

This is work in progress but I always maintain it in "ready-to-launch"
state.

HOWTO
=====

* create twitter app on https://dev.twitter.com/apps
* put credentials into lab.cfg
* run it : python twitter_lab.py

Requirements
====
* python-twitter
* ConfigParser (should be shipped with python) 
* tested on Python 2.7.3

TODO
====
* complete twitter backend
* hashtag support
* global search support
* perceptuality analysis 
* stress/emotional volume analysis
* behavioral analysis
